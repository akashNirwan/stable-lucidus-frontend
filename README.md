📏 Coding Standards
JavaScript / TypeScript

Use console.error() only for errors (🚫 console.log() in production).

Write clean, readable code with proper indentation.

Functions and components must have meaningful names.

CSS / Styling

Use kebab-case for class names and file/folder names.

Example: button-primary, card-container

Follow consistent spacing, color usage, and style tokens from the design guide.

Components Structure

Each component should have its own folder (named in kebab-case).

/components/button/button.tsx
/components/card/card.tsx
